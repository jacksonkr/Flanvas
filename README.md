Flanvas is an open source framework based on Javascript in use with the HTML 5 Canvas tag. Flanvas will ALWAYS stay open-source and free. The intention was and is to create a framework that will help the web progress into what it will be tomorrow. Third party plugins have managed to get us to where the web is currently (thank you) and it's time to move things into platform friendly HTML and Javascript, which is what flanvas is all about.
 
Flanvas runs on the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Test devices have been iPhone and iPad (both working). IE requires a plugin to enable the canvas tag to work correctly. We are crossing our fingers for IE 9.
