** DISCONTINUED **

I have decided this morning to discontuinue flanvas. I recently found out that Flash now exports to html5. It's not the most elegant solution but it works. At this point I'm going to start working on paperjs to make it es6 friendly. You can check out the development in my paperjs clone.

Flanvas
-----

Flanvas is an open source framework based on Javascript in use with the HTML5 Canvas tag. Flanvas will always stay open-source and free. The intention was and is to create a framework that will help the web progress into what it will be tomorrow. Third party plugins have managed to get us to where the web is currently (thank you) and it's time to move things into platform friendly HTML and Javascript, which is what Flanvas is all about.
 
Flanvas runs on most HTML5 friendly browsers.
